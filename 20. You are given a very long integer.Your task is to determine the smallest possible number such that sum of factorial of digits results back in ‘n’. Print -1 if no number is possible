You are given a very long integer.Your task is to determine the smallest possible number such that sum of factorial of digits results back in ‘n’. Print -1 if no number is possible
Sample Input :
145
Sample Output :
145




n = int(input())
s = ''
while(True):
    k = 1
    i = 1
    while(k<=n):
        k = k*i
        i = i+1
    k = k//(i-1) 
    s = s+str(i-2)
    n = n-k
    if n == 0:
        break
print(s[::-1])
