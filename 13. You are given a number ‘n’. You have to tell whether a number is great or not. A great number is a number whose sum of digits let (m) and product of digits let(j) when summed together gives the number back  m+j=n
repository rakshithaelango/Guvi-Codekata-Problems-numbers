You are given a number ‘n’. You have to tell whether a number is great or not. A great number is a number whose sum of digits let (m) and product of digits let(j) when summed together gives the number back
m+j=n
Sample Input :
59
Sample Output :
Great



 n = int(input())
t = n
d = 1
r = 0
p = 1
while(n>0):
    d = n%10
    r += d
    n = n//10
    p = d*p
A = r+p
if A == t:
    print('Great')
else:
    print('no')
